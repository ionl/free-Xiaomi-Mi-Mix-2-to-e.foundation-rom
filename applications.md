### Feedback after 1 month

> Overall, very nice. but

* advantage

    - only application usefull. No crapware / junkware / .*ware
    - no access to xiaomi server anymore
    - possibility to have mail and nextcloud env with 5 Go storage. Powerfull ecosystem to leave Google Apps
    - no useless data/connection outside

* drawback

    - Wifi access point issue. Can't authenticate (only with some manipulations I can't remember)
    - MMS can only be sent with activated DATA (some rom, automatically manage that)
    - MMS can only sent with accurate GPS (?)
    - Launcher is very light, we can't remove left windows
    - Problem with my rom. Need to remove 1 line in `META-INF/com/google/android/updater-script`
